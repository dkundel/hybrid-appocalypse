# Hybrid Appocalypse

This is the repository for a talk about developing Hybrid Apps (with a focus on Desktop).

The slides are written using Reveal.js and are loaded inside an Electron shell to achieve their full functionality.

If you are looking for resources about hybrid app development check out the [RESOURCES.md](RESOURCES.md) file.

This talk has been presented at:
- [Devfest Austria 2016 in Vienna](http://devfest.at)
- [Microsoft Technology Summit Germany 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/germany/technical-summit/default.aspx)
- [Topconf DÃ¼sseldorf 2017](https://www.topconf.com/conference/duesseldorf-2017/)
